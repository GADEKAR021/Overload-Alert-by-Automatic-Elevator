# Overload-Alert-by-Automatic-Elevator

Automatic elevator safety system that keeps riders safe by detecting and alerting them of overcrowding. It uses load sensors and microcontrollers to measure weight in real-time, along with signal processing to analyze the data. To warn passengers, the system employs a combination of audio, visual, and potentially even tactile alerts. The authors emphasize the importance of human behavior and recommend using statistical analysis to evaluate the system's success.
